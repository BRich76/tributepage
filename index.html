    <h1> CoryxKenshin Tribute Page </h1>
    <h2> Black Excellence at its Finest</h2>
    <p> CoryxKenshin is a famous black YouTuber who started his channel 12 years ago. He started out uploading part time videos at his college in Michigan. He soon decided that this was going to be his calling and took a huge risk dropping out of college to be a full time YouTuber in 2015. Turns out it worked, right? In my humble opinion, one of the greatest, if not, the GREATEST YouTuber to ever do it.</p>

    <p class = "secondwordsp"> As you can see he is very funny and edits all his videos by himself. No editing team, no huge group. He does ALL his editing and it is undebatably the best on YouTube.</p>

<div class="conclusion">
    <h1> Conclusion</h1>
    
    <p> The reason why I love Cory so much is that he not only relates to me a lot but his videos pick you up when you are down. He is Black, like me, also Christian, like video games, likes Japanese folklore and culture, even has a bit of my humor. But he is always giving back to the community. He never fails to be real about himself and his situation. Out of many people I have chosen to watch, I am glad I am experiencing this man's success. Truly Black Excellence.</p>
